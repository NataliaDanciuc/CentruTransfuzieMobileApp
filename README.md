# CentruTransfuzieMobileApp
In this Repository we have implemented a multi-platform mobile application with .NET MAUI with the theme of a Blood Transfusion Center. With the help of this application, each person can compile a list of the medical tests they need, as well as the transfusion center where they want to make an appointment. Based on the entered address, the application will be able to open the map as well
we will get navigation directions. Also if the distance between the location of the device and
the location of the store is less than 1 km, the application will send us a notification.
